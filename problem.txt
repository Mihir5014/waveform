Overview
--------
Design and implement a Music Player Application that allows users to:
- Manage multiple playlists
- Play, pause, and navigate through songs
- Use different playback modes (NONE, SHUFFLE, REPEAT)
- Like or Unlike songs

1. Basic Functionality
----------------------

1.1 Song Selection and Playback
- Users should be able to select and play any specific song from a playlist.
- Provide the ability to:
  - Play the currently selected song
  - Pause the currently playing song
  - Toggle between play and pause states

1.2 Like/Unlike Songs
- Allow users to like or unlike a song to personalize their music preferences.

2. Navigation Controls
----------------------

2.1 Next and Previous Song Logic
Implement `next()` and `previous()` functionality based on playback mode:

Mode: NONE (Linear Playback)
- Next:
  - If current song is not the last in the playlist -> Play the next song in the same playlist.
  - If current song is the last in the playlist:
    - If current playlist is not the last -> Play the first song of the next playlist.
    - If current playlist is the last -> Play the first song of the first playlist.
- Previous:
  - If current song is not the first in the playlist -> Play the previous song in the same playlist.
  - If current song is the first in the playlist:
    - If current playlist is not the first -> Play the last song of the previous playlist.
    - If current playlist is the first -> Play the last song of the last playlist.

3. Playback Modes
-----------------

3.1 Mode Management
Supported playback modes:
- NONE – Linear playback
- SHUFFLE – Random song from current playlist
- REPEAT – Repeat songs in current playlist

3.2 Mode Behaviors
- NONE Mode:
  - Songs are played sequentially as per the navigation rules above.
  - Automatically progresses to the next song when the current one ends.
- SHUFFLE Mode:
  - Randomly selects and plays a song from the current playlist.
  - Repeats the random selection on each next song request.
